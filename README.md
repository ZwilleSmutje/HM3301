# HM3301 Re-evaluing Master Thesis TU Berlin H.Koffinke
All of my work is free to use for anyone.
I will lay out my findings in my master thesis (and also the LateX files)

The code here refers to an Arduino GSM1400 hooked up with an ENV-Shield, DHT11 Sensor and a RTC

Short overview
0) Grove-HM3301 Laser PM2.5 Sensor is put up to test
1) two identical devices will be used
2) calibration needs to be taken
3) relative humidity and temperature need to be measured

To repeat this experiment:
1) read my thesis
